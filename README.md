# Game of Life
This is an implementation of the "Game of Life" zero-player game. It has one outside dependency (scanner.py).

It represents almost the totality of my Python experience aside from a little bit of experimentation with BeautifulSoup and a one-off Twitter script.

### How To Use This Script
You'll need Python3.3 installed.

life.py takes the three following parameters: grid_file length_of_y_axis length_of_x_axis

To run the included example file:

```bash
$ python3.3 life.py example.dat 8 7
```
